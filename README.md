# bank_transaction_reports
categorise bank transactions and produce reports


So far, the best way to get the csv of the transactions is to 
go to the transactions page for the account, do search/filter
and get the whole year's worth


For the category lookups, I guess what I really want to know about is ongoing bills.

categories should be
Supermarket
Eating Out
Utility Bills
Takeaway
Car
Dog
Streaming Subscriptions
Interest
